                    'Profiler::NYTProf',
                    base_URL => 'http://example.com/NYTProf',
                    root     => '/path/to/NYTProf',
                    minimal  => 1,

DESCRIPTION
    Adds a debug panel that runs and displays Devel::NYTProf on your perl
    source code.

OPTIONS
    This debug panel defines the following options.

  root
    Where to store nytprof.out and nytprofhtml output (default: '/tmp').

  base_URL
    By default, this module will grab requests with the string nytprofhtml
    to the server, and deliver the reports with Plack::App::File. If instead
    you don't want to serve the reports from the same server you're
    debugging, then you can set this option to the URL where the root folder
    above can be reached.

  exclude
    List of excluded paths (default: [qw(.*\.css .*\.png .*\.ico .*\.js)]).

  minimal
    By default, nytprofhtml will generate graphviz .dot files and
    block/sub-level reports. Setting this to a true value will disable this
    behaviour and make nytprofhtml considerably faster.

  no_merge_evals
    By defaut, nytprofhtml will merge string evals in the reports. Setting
    this to a true value will disable this behaviour. Warning: this will
    make nytprohtml considerably slower, and might timeout the HTTP request.

Environment Variable
  NYTPROF
    You can customize Devel::NYTProf's behaviour by setting the NYTPROF
    environment variable as specified in its documentation. However, this
    module requires the following to hold:

   addpid=1
   start=begin
